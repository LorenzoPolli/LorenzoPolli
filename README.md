👋 Hi, I'm @LorenzoPolli! <br />
👀 My last project is about the application of NLP techniques to compare three popular Italian TV News. <br />
🤝 I'm available to collaborate on some interesting projects that possibly deal with Web Scraping, Text Mining, Complex Graph Networks and Sentiment Analysis. However, anything related with numbers could be of interest (I also love investigating trends in sports). 
🐍 I prefer coding in Python. <br />

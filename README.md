👋 Hi, I’m @LorenzoPolli!
👀 My last project is about the application of NLP techniques to compare three popular Italian TV News.
🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on some interesting projects, possibly in topics such as: Web Scraping, Text Mining, Sentiment Analysis, and Complex Networks. However, anything related with numbers could be of interest. I generally code in Python.

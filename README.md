👋 Hi, I'm @LorenzoPolli! <br />
👀 My last project is about the application of NLP techniques to compare three popular Italian TV News. <br />
🤝 I'm avilable to collaborate on some interesting projects, possibly in topics such as Web Scraping, Complex Networks, Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis. However, anything related with numbers could be of interest (I also love investigating trends in sports). I generally code in Python. <br />
